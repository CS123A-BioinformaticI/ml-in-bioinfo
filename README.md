## Dataset
In the data file, there are 6 .py files. One .py file is to create the dataset 

1. Run organize_dataset.py to create the dataset and export it
2. Run the 5 question files to see the visualizations of the dataset

## Machine Learning Model
We used two machine learning models in order to compare the two to see which model would run best with our dataset.

Run LinearRegression.ipynb to see the results for Linear Regression
Run RandomForestRegressor.ipynb to see the results for Random Forest Regressor
